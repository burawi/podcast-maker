2024-09-22 17:51:41 - Added autocomplete functionality for path inputs in video_generator.py:
- Imported readline module
- Created path_completer function for autocomplete
- Added setup_autocomplete function to configure readline
- Modified main() function to use input_with_autocomplete for path inputs
- Updated relevant input prompts to use the new autocomplete feature

2024-09-22 17:54:48 - Updated video_generator.py to accept command-line arguments and implement interactive input for missing arguments:
- Imported argparse module
- Added ArgumentParser object with arguments for all required inputs
- Created prompt_for_missing_args function to handle interactive input for missing arguments
- Modified main() function to parse command-line arguments and use prompt_for_missing_args
- Updated generate_video() function call to use parsed arguments
- Maintained backward compatibility with interactive input if no arguments are provided

2024-09-22 20:55:34 - Modified video_generator.py to change the audio visualization:
- Updated create_audio_visualization function to use a circle of bars instead of a line plot
- Removed the black circle surrounding the waves by setting ax.spines['polar'].set_visible(False)
- Removed the white background by setting transparent background for the figure and axes
- Changed the plot to use bar plot (ax.bar) instead of line plot (ax.plot)
- Adjusted the bar width and alpha for better visibility
- Ensured the audio visualization appears directly above the chosen background image

2024-09-23 10:30:15 - Added Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the application:
- Created a new file gui.py with PyQt5-based GUI implementation
- Updated video_generator.py to include progress and log callbacks
- Modified generate_video function to accept and use progress and log callbacks
- Updated README.md with instructions for running the GUI version
- Confirmed PyQt5 is included in requirements.txt
- Integrated video generation process with GUI, including progress bar and log output
- Added color picker functionality for heading text, outline, and wave colors in GUI
- Implemented file browser buttons for selecting audio and image files in GUI

2024-09-23 14:45:22 - Optimized video_generator.py for improved rendering performance:
- Implemented frame caching for audio visualization using functools.lru_cache
- Set CACHE_SIZE to 100 frames to balance memory usage and performance
- Optimized text rendering by creating the text image only once instead of per frame
- Adjusted video writing parameters for better performance:
  - Set bitrate to '5000k' for improved video quality
  - Used 'faster' preset for quicker encoding
  - Added '-crf 23' to ffmpeg_params for a good balance between quality and file size
- Rounded time values in make_frame to 2 decimal places for better cache utilization
- These optimizations are expected to significantly reduce rendering time and improve overall performance
