Create a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to generate customized videos. The application should have the following features and functionality:

GUI Layout:

Create a main window with a menu bar and a central area for controls and preview.
Include file selection buttons for audio and image inputs.
Add text input fields for the video heading.
Implement color pickers for the heading color, heading outline color, and audio wave color.
Add a dropdown menu or similar control for selecting the heading font.
Include a "Generate Video" button to start the video creation process.
Add a preview area to show a static representation of the final video layout.


Input Handling:

Allow users to select an audio file (support common formats like MP3, WAV).
Enable users to choose an image file for the video background (support formats like JPG, PNG).
Implement text input for the video heading, with real-time preview if possible.


Customization Options:

Font selection for the heading (provide a list of installed system fonts).
Color selection for the heading text, heading outline, and audio wave visualization.
Option to adjust the size and position of the heading text.


Video Generation:

Use the selected image as the video background.
Overlay the audio wave visualization on the background:

Create a circular audio wave visualization that reacts to the audio file.
Position the visualization in an aesthetically pleasing way (e.g., centered or off to one side).


Add the customized heading text to the video.
Use the selected audio file as the soundtrack for the video.
Ensure the video length matches the duration of the audio file.


Output:

Generate the video file in a common format (e.g., MP4).
Allow the user to specify the output location and filename.


Error Handling:

Implement proper error checking for file inputs, text inputs, and the video generation process.
Display user-friendly error messages when issues occur.


Additional Features (if time allows):

Add a progress bar for the video generation process.
Implement a basic preview functionality to show how the video will look before full generation.
Allow users to save and load project settings.



Use appropriate Python libraries for GUI development (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt), video processing (e.g., MoviePy, OpenCV), audio processing (e.g., pydub, librosa), and visualization (e.g., matplotlib, pyqtgraph). Ensure the code is well-organized, possibly using object-oriented programming principles to manage the complexity of the application.
Remember to handle potential performance issues, especially during the video generation process, and consider using threading to keep the GUI responsive while processing.
